In this assignment I got to know about the rule matching algorithms in firewall.I learnt about simple
firewalls and there types and got to know about there way of working.Overall it was a great 
experience and learnt many new things about firewalls.

Different efficient algorithms and more complex rules if discussed in this project could have made the project more interesting.Although this project also had their own challenges but few other interesting challenges could have been better.
